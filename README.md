Hi, I'm Mist, a developer from Chengdu, China with more than 6 years of experience. Currently, I'm working on blockchain projects, but I'm always open to new ideas. I'm a big fan of TypeScript, as well as Rust, Haskell, and Go. I also love functional programming.
<br />
        <br />
I have a passion for programming language and framework design, and I have plans to create my own programming language called Mist. However, I haven't started the project yet, so there's nothing to show for it. If you're interested in this project, please feel free to contact me.

And I'm also a big fan of pixel art, abstract reality, and drawing on paper. Pixel art is a cool way to express how you see things, and I find it fascinating.

Currently, in addition to creating pixel art, I'm working hard on Kickflip. If you have any tips, please let me know! üôè
