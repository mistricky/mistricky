## How to define Mist
Hii, thereðŸ‘‹! My name is Mist, a WEB <developer /> from ChengDu, I'm working on blockchain wallet currently, and Mist is also name of an Ethereum wallet. Actually  coding already is a important part of my life, nowdays, I'd love to spend most of my free time at [Wizardoc](https://github.com/wizardoc/wizard), I need to be a product manager and UI designer in this project and also a developer, if you interested in [Wizardoc](https://github.com/wizardoc/wizard), maybe you can be a contributor to it, let's happy coding!!
